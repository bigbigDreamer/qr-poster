English | [简体中文](./README.ZH.md)

Based on `React`, a poster QR code component with `Headless Component` feature.

## Background

In common event promotion, it is often necessary to share promotional posters or set up sales signs at the front desk. We hope to further improve the efficiency of business development.

The traditional 'UI' components are difficult to meet the flexible and complex layout of QR code posters, requiring a solution that can adapt to changes.

## Target

- Encapsulate core poster generation and storage capabilities;
- Excellent compatibility, meeting the needs of low-end devices with `webview` kernel;
- `Headless` feature;

## Component design
